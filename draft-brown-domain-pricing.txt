Internet-Draft        Premium Domain Pricing Format        February 2015


1.  Introduction

   As described in [draft-brown-epp-fees], the current expansion of the
   DNS namespace has resulted in the development of a number of novel
   business models.  Many Top-Level Domain Registry Operators have
   implemented a system of premium or tiered pricing, whereby higher
   registration and renewal fees are levied for certain domain names.

   This document proposed a standard format for premium domain pricing
   information, based on the Comma-Separated Variables (CSV) format
   described in [RFC4180].  Adoption of this format by registries, back-
   end registry operators, registrars, and other entities within the
   domain name industry will facilitate the exchange of premium pricing
   information between these entities, which will encourage
   participation in, and adoption of, the innovative business models
   that the New gTLD Program has enabled.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  Format for Premium Pricing Information

   Premium Pricing Information for a single Top-Level Domain MUST be
   provided in a single Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file.  This file
   MUST be compliant with the specification for CSV files described in
   [RFC4180].  The format for this file is described below.

2.1.  Contents

   The file MUST contain complete pricing information for all domains
   within the TLD.  Partial information, or information split across
   multiple files, MUST not be accepted.

2.2.  File Name

   The file name MUST have the following format:

         TLD-CURRENCY-YYYY-MM-DD-Z.CSV

   Where:

   1.  "TLD" is the top-level domain label

Internet-Draft        Premium Domain Pricing Format        February 2015


   2.  "CURRENCY" is the [ISO4217] three-character currency code

   3.  "YYYY-MM-DD" is the date the file was created (eg 2014-12-01)

   4.  "Z" is an unsigned integer version number

2.3.  Columns

   The file MUST contain the following columns:

   +-------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
   | Column      | Description         | Format                        |
   +-------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+
   |             |                     |                               |
   | fqdn        | The fully-qualified | ^[a-z0-9\-]{1,63}\.[a-z]{2,}$ |
   |             | domain name         |                               |
   |             |                     |                               |
   | class       | The class to which  | ^[A-Za-z0-9\-]{0,}$           |
   |             | the domain belongs  |                               |
   |             |                     |                               |
   | reg_fee     | Registration fee    | ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]{2}$            |
   |             | (per year)          |                               |
   |             |                     |                               |
   | renewal_fee | Renewal fee         | (as above)                    |
   |             | (per year)          |                               |
   |             |                     |                               |
   |             |                     |                               |
   | restore_fee | RGP restore fee     | (as above)                    |
   |             |                     |                               |
   +-------------+---------------------+-------------------------------+

   The "Format" column in the table describes the regular expression
   that MUST be used to validate the value of the column.  The regular
   expression is in [PCRE] syntax.

   The "fqdn" column MUST NOT contain any of the following:

   o  Upper-case ASCII characters

   o  White space (space or tab characters, non-printable characters,
      etc)

   o  IDN U-labels (only A-labels are accepted)

   o  Non-alphanumeric characters (with the exception of U+002D "Hyphen
      Minus")

   o  Domain names that are not fully-qualified.

   o  A trailing period (U+002E) at the end of the domain name.

   The "class" column is OPTIONAL and relates to the <fee:class> element
   described in [draft-brown-epp-fees] and identifies the class, tier,
   or category for the domain.

   The registration, renewal and restore fee columns MUST NOT contain
   any of the following:

   o  Currency symbols

   o  Commas separating groups of numerals

   o  More than 2 decimal places

2.4.  Record and Field Delimiters

   Fields MUST be delimited by commas (U+002C).  Records MUST be
   delimited by CRLF (U+000D U+000A).

2.5.  Quoting and Escaping

   Fields SHOULD NOT be quoted.  Characters within fields SHOULD NOT be
   escaped.  The permitted values for the columns in this specification
   mean that quoting and escaping are not necessary.

2.6.  Character Encoding

   The file MUST be encoded as US-ASCII or UTF-8.  Due to the
   restrictions on the content described in this document, both
   encodings will produce the same byte sequence.

2.7.  Compression

   The file MAY be compressed.  If compression is used, the filename
   MUST have the appropriate extension (ie .gz, .bz2, .zip) appended to
   it.  The filename of the uncompressed file MUST have the form
   described above.
